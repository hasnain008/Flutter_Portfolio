# Flutter Portfolio ‚Äì main.dart Only

This is a simplified version of my Flutter portfolio app. I'm sharing only the `main.dart` file to showcase my Flutter UI design, code structure, and theme toggle functionality. This project was created as part of my Flutter practice.

## üåó Features

- Dark mode and light mode toggle üåô‚òÄÔ∏è
- Clean and modern UI
- Fully written in `main.dart`
- Responsive layout with basic animations

## üìÑ File Included

- `main.dart` ‚Äì Contains the full UI, logic, and theme toggle code

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is not a full Flutter project. It only includes the main Dart file for demonstration purposes.

## üîß How to Use

To run this code:
1. Create a new Flutter project
2. Replace the content of `lib/main.dart` with the code from this file
3. Run the app using:
   ```bash
   flutter run
